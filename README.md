# reproducible_WCtemplatePackage
Reproducibility Course Module 4 Weather Check template package

This R package provides an R markdown template for creating a report from the Weather Check dataset from the `fivethirtyeight` R package. 

To install the development version of this package from Github, you may use the `devtools` package to run this R code `devtools::install_github('analysisinsightdata/reproducible_WCtemplatePackage')`.

REALITY CHECK
This probably is not working if you are following along the course materials because of the Github main vs master change in 2021 that didn't get updated in other documentation and packages.  Sorry.
